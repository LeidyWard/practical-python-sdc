    "## So, what is Python?\n",
    "   - An interpreted, dynamically typed, high-level language written by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
    "   - Orignally created to make learning and teaching programming very easy\n",
    "   - Written in C (Python 2 and 3 are known as CPython 2 and CPython 3)\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Why use Python?\n",
    "   - Widely developed with and for (LOTS of packages and libraries)\n",
    "   - Amazing for rapid software development; a lot less to worry about\n",
    "   - But interpreted langauges are slow: (pypy - https://pypy.org/)\n",
    "     - You can also compile Python using [Cython](http://cython.org/) or [Nubma](https://numba.pydata.org/)\n",
    "   - But I don't like dynamically typed langauges: (mypy - https://github.com/python/mypy)\n",
    "   - But equals sign assignment is mathematically incorrect: (PEP 0527 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/)\n",
    "     - Example: `x = 5` vs `x := 5`\n",
    "     \n",
    "### Where not to use Python\n",
    "   - Microsoft Windows GUI Development (.NET)\n",
    "       - Use [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) and [pyqt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt) at your own risk!\n",
    "   - Systems that require very complex concurrency, with or without thread-safety (Erlang)\n",
    "   - Embedded systems with limited hardware resources"
